# Welcome to the GAN Image Generation Project! This project utilizes Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate images similar to those in the dataset.
# In this project, the goal is to leverage the power of GANs to create realistic images resembling a given dataset. The discriminator loss achieved is 0.34, indicating its ability to distinguish between real and generated images. The generator loss, standing at 1.52, reflects the effectiveness of our model in generating high-quality images
# To run the GAN model, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the 'research' directory.
3. Open the 'GANtrial2.ipynb' notebook.
4. Execute the code cells in sequential order.
